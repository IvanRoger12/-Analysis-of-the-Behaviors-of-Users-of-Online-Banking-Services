# -Analysis-of-the-Behaviors-of-Users-of-Online-Banking-Services
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze user behavior in online banking services to provide personalized experiences, optimize operations, and anticipate trends. With the rapid digital transformation in the banking sector, understanding and adapting to user needs is crucial. This project leverages data science and machine learning to identify user habits, monitor real-time changes (data drift), and adjust services accordingly.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Understand user behavior in online banking: Identify transaction types, usage times, and user preferences (e.g., mobile vs. web).
Detect behavioral changes (Data Drift): Monitor shifts in user behavior over time to adapt services as needed.
Anticipate user needs: Use predictive analytics to tailor the experience, improve user retention, and provide a more engaging and personalized service.
Data Sources
The project utilizes various data sources, including:

Connection Data: Time, frequency, and type of device used (e.g., mobile, desktop).
Transaction Data: Frequency, amount, and types of transactions (e.g., payments, transfers).
Behavioral Data: Feature usage frequency, user journey, and engagement metrics.
Customer Feedback: User satisfaction scores and feedback to gauge the overall user experience and identify areas for improvement.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and structure data to ensure quality and consistency. This includes handling missing values and removing outliers.
Behavioral Change Analysis (Data Drift): Use divergence metrics (such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Wasserstein distance) to compare training and production data, enabling real-time monitoring of user behavior changes.
Modeling and Segmentation:
Clustering: Segment users based on behavior patterns (e.g., frequent, moderate, occasional users) for targeted actions and insights.
Predictive Modeling: Forecast future behavior to anticipate user needs and detect engagement or loyalty risks.
Key Visualizations and Insights
The presentation includes several key visualizations to convey insights effectively:

User Behavior Distribution by Transaction Type: Highlights the most popular services, helping prioritize service enhancements.
KL and Wasserstein Distance Evolution Over Time: Tracks real-time changes in user behavior to adjust offerings proactively.
User Connection Times Histogram: Identifies peak usage periods, allowing for optimal resource allocation and targeted notifications.
Monthly Transaction Trends: Observes seasonal trends in transaction types to better anticipate user needs.
Business Benefits
This project offers several tangible benefits for the bank, particularly in terms of performance and customer satisfaction:

Enhanced Customer Engagement: Tailored offerings and notifications based on individual usage patterns.
Operational Cost Savings: Better forecasting of high-demand periods helps optimize infrastructure and reduce costs.
Improved Security: Automatic detection of unusual behavior patterns to strengthen fraud prevention.
Summary Table of Benefits
The project also includes a summary table comparing pre- and post-project impacts for the business, internal teams, and clients. This table demonstrates the positive impact of behavioral analysis on areas like responsiveness, personalization, satisfaction, retention, and internal collaboration.
